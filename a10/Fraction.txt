# This file shows the patterns your Fraction class needs to be able to
# read.  A Fraction may be just a single integer, two integers separated by
# a slash, or a mixed number which consists of an integer, followed by a +
# and then two integers with a slash.  A minus sign may appear in the
# very first character to indicate the whole Fraction is negative.
# No white space is allowed in between the component parts of a Fraction.
